Last weekend, I watched 《Gaudians of Galaxy:2》. It's a really awesome sifi move, although the first episode is little better. In this episode, star lord meets with his biological father: Ego. EGO is a kind of Alien with very powerfull capability! Actually, he is a planet whose core is his giant brain. It is said that his brain was formed naturally in the universe. Years passing by, the brain cound control surrounding dusts and particles. Finally, the brain planet appeared! It's a wonderful fantasy, but it has theoretical fundamentals. It is called Boltzmann brain which comes from Physical cosmology. However, it's just a hypothesis right now. It mainly describes that the probability of generating consciousness is higher than the probability of generating consciousness's carrier in the space, such as the human body. Theoretically, there should be many consciousnesses like Boltsman brains in the universe, but we still haven't found them right now. The details are more mathematical, I still can't understand it. But the phenomenon that many brains travel in the universe is very funny.

After the completion of Stochastic Process's test, I think I need to dig more deep about Stochastic Process, it's a tough course whose contents are very new, the majoirty of its theories are developed in 20 centry. It mainly describe some Probability Models' behavior on the time dimention, such as: Poisson Process, Markov chains, Martingales. Besides research on that, I also have to learn advanced statistics in coming 3 months.

Time flies fast! More than half year have passed since last write, it seems that I didn't make the great progress. Although I have completed five courses from deeplearning.ai, I think it's not enough. I want to write a small book to note the stuffs I learned from the courses.  $x^{(i)}$
