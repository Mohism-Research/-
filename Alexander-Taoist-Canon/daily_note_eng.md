Last weekend, I watched 《Gaudians of Galaxy:2》. It's a really awesome sifi move, although the first episode is little better. In this episode, star lord meets with his biological father: Ego. EGO is a kind of Alien with very powerfull capability! Actually, he is a planet whose core is his giant brain. It is said that his brain was formed naturally in the universe. Years passing by, the brain cound control surrounding dusts and particles. Finally, the brain planet appeared! It's a wonderful fantasy, but it has theoretical fundamentals. It is called Boltzmann brain which comes from Physical cosmology. However, it's just a hypothesis right now. It mainly describes that the probability of generating consciousness is higher than the probability of generating consciousness's carrier in the space, such as the human body. Theoretically, there should be many consciousnesses like Boltsman brains in the universe, but we still haven't found them right now. The details are more mathematical, I still can't understand it. But the phenomenon that many brains travel in the universe is very funny.
