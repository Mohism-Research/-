# How the Steel Was Tempered #

# 0. Introduction #

This tutorial is mainly used for training very junior mohism staffs who will become the tough warriors in the near future. The trainning works can be classified into three categoties: **Spiritually powerfull**, **Technically mature** and **Physically strong**.

# 1. Spiritual issues #

The spiritual force is very powerfull, somtimes it's stronger than the nuclear bomb if the method is applied appropriately. The spiritual forces have several original sources: one is religion, another is philosophical thinking. The religion is little far behand the modern society, but the philosophy is never out of time. Now we focus the two Chinese traditional phylosophies: Taoism and Mohism. Taoism is for self-management and keeping healthy and long-living. Mohism is for team-working and team descpline establishment.

## 1.1 Taoism ##

[The six words secret](https://github.com/Mohism-Research/Super-Taoism-Archives/blob/master/six-words-secret.md) can be used to boost our spiritual force, importantly we need practise it **everyday**. The method can make our emotions more peaceful　although　it seems very easy! It can get rid of the weakness from our bodies.

## 1.2 Mohism ##

# 2. Technical issues #

## 2.1 The usage of git and github ##

I have Written the simple tutorial for git banner, new staffs can access it under the directory named "bannercamp". In order to use git under github more conveniently, staffs should add the ssh key generated by your working desktop into the personal github account. The more details are below:

https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

The git is a very powerfull and complicated version control tool, nobody could master it completely, so the reference book is very essencial for both new users and experienced users. I strongly recommend [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2) for mohism staffs.

## 2.2 How to use Internet scientifically ##

Accessing Google is very essential for software engineers and academics, but due to some political issues google services have been forbiden in mainland area for years. Therefore Setting VPN channel via Shadowsock becomes very important.

Setting up VPN via Shadowsocks includes Servier side works and client side works. Server side works need higher undertanding of Linux, so I only post the client tutorial below:

https://shadowsocks.com.hk/client.html

There are many platforms implementations of shadownsocks clients. The configuraion is simple, if you already have a workable account.

## 2.3 The usage of Linux desktop ##

If one wants to control Linux desktop, knowing some usual terminal commands is indispensable. In my opinion, the best study resource is [鸟哥的 Linux 私房菜](http://cn.linux.vbird.org/). The content of it is very handy and easy to understand. However, reading man pages is the senior users' tough road.

## 2.4 Programming ##

This is the most important skill to be a modern mohism staff, but there's no need much under this section. Because we already have the better tutorial for newbies:

[How To Become A Hacker](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#basic_skills)

It's a really wonderfull literature in educating new programmers, it's written by Eric Steven Raymond who is a very famous hacker in Free Software world.

# 3. Physical issues #

## 3.1 20 minutes sports per day ##

## 3.2 Physical tests ##

# 4. Focus #

Like Magnifying glass focus at one point .Donot switch task in our brain.

Set target Do One thing at one time. The less and more power.

we should refresh the rubish.

The Hotter It Gets, The More Focused The Winner Becomes

Focus,Focus,Focus and then there is a breakout!!!

Fool -----Distraction Is The Loser’s Companion 

If You Lose Focus You’ll Be Blinded To The Truth and nature.

# 5. How To Slove Trouble Quickly(TODO)
Small step
Not Prepare 80% then to do ,if there is 20% we also can to 
Do thing find Trouble and slove ---do again and slove －－－we call that **iteration**
迭代是重复反馈过程的活动，其目的通常是为了接近并到达所需的目标或结果。每一次对过程的重复被称为一次“迭代”，而每一次迭代得到的结果会被用来作为下一次迭代的初始值。
**所以每一次的迭代会越来越接近最终的目标。**
迭代式开发，不要求每一个阶段的任务做的都是最完美的，而是明明知道还有很多不足的地方，却偏偏不去完善它，而是把主要功能先搭建起来为目的，以最短的时间，在最短的時間內，人員最少的情況下，快速的實現目標！
